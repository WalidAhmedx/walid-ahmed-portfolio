# Walid Ahmed — Final Website Package (Canva Template)

- `index.html` is the Canva export (layout/styles unchanged) with a tiny script to:
  - swap hero/About circular icons with `assets/img/walid.png`,
  - wire the Download CV button to `assets/cv/Walid_Ahmed_CV.pdf`,
  - embed two videos into the Video Demonstrations section.
- Videos placed in `assets/videos/`:
  - `demo-1.mp4`, `demo-2.mp4`

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1) Create a repo (e.g., `walid-ahmed-portfolio`).
2) Upload all files at repository root.
3) Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` → `/root`.
